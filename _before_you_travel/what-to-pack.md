**Packing list for traveling to Tanzania**

Our Kibokoland Adventure cars have a cigarette lighter to power your devices, but you'll need to bring your own audio and USB cables. If you use Spotify, don't forget to download your favorite road trip songs so you can listen to them off-line. Audio books are also great fun to listen to during long drives, or whilst sitting around a campfire or lying in your tent (try a thriller!). The Rough Guide Swahili Phrasebook comes in handy when traveling off the beaten track.

Take a look at our camping gear list to check whether it contains everything you want on your camping holiday in Tanzania. A Power bank comes in handy if you plan to camp a lot. A fleece blanket is nice for chilling on the grass or to cover up during the chillier nights. Definitely bring insect repellent and sun block, as these are more expensive in Tanzania. The interior highlands are cooler in the evenings, so bring a fleece or jumper. Arusha and Dar es Salaam have many well-stocked supermarkets and pharmacies where you can buy all the essentials, in case you forget anything. Obviously, this is not the case in provincial towns.

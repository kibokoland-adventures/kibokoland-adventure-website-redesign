**Weâ€™ve slept in the beds, tasted the food, met the people and seen the wildlife. Then we went back and did it all again, just to be sure. Weâ€™ll keep on going back to ensure that what we recommend is perfect for you. The prices mentioned in our accommodation overview were last updated in 2018.**

**Traveling Tanzania on a budget**

Not want to break the bank? You will find plenty of decent budget and mid-range accommodation at a much lower price range in the Usambaras, Udzungwa Mountains and along the coast between Pangani and Dar es Salaam.

Public campsites in the national parks do not require any advance arrangements - most of them can't even be booked in advance. Read more about preparing for your camping safari in Tanzania, at the camping section.

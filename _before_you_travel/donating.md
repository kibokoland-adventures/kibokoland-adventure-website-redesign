**Travel Tanzania responsibly**

Some advice to consider

- Do not hand out money, clothes, pens, sweets or whatever else to children. However cute and poor they might be, it encourages begging and a distorted view of tourists. Instead, show genuine interest, play and talk with these kids the way you would with children from your own country.

- If you want to bring goods to Tanzania, your lodge owner is a good source of advice. They know how to distribute it best. We personally feel it is better to leave it up to them, instead of playing Santa Claus and donating in person. The same applies for leaving stuff behind in your room - it's better to give it to the lodge owner than leave it for the maid to find, which can lead to friction among the staff.

- Most lodges have a tipping box and distribute the tips equally among all the staff. If you enjoyed the service, just be generous and contribute to the tipping box. As for your driver or guide, tipping is highly appreciated.

**Preparing for your camping safari in Tanzania**

**Are campsites widely available in Tanzania?**

Lodges in the National Parks in Tanzania are expensive. Good to know that Tanzania is a great country for camping safaris! There are numerous campsites all over the country, so it is possible to explore Tanzania on a budget. From basic bush campsites inside the parks to private campsites operated by lodge owners - the latter enabling you to stay at a secured site with good amenities whilst sleeping for a dime. Moreover, the opportunities to camp are year round because of Tanzaniaâ€™s warm climate.

If you want to stay inside the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the most affordable option is Simba Public Campsite A, the only public campsite on the crater rim. The rest are special campsites or luxury lodges.

The most affordable place to stay inside the the Serengeti are the public campsites. There is a cluster of 7 campsites near Seronera, the central area of the park, and a cluster of campsites in the North at Lobo area. During the migration, this is a good place to stay. Itâ€™s around 2 hour drive from Seronera.

**Do I need to book my campsites in advance?**

You donâ€™t need to book your public campsites in advance. There are several public campsites in every national park and you will always be assigned a campsite when you arrive at the park entrance. It works a bit different if you want to stay inside the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and/or the Wildlife Management Association (which is Lake Natron). If you want to visit these conservation areas, you need to obtain a reservation quote first, before you can go to the gate to pay for the park entrance. On this reservation quote, you have to mention the campsite where you will be staying.

**How can I book a special campsite in the national parks of Tanzania?**The so-called special campsites are largely reserved by private safari companies who bid on those for the season. As an individual traveler, you canâ€™t stay there. The less interesting special campsites are not taken by the safari companies and are available to book by individual travelers.

It is not easy to secure a spot and these camps are more expensive, but you will enjoy a true wilderness experience camping at an isolated location.

If you prefer to stay at a special campsite instead of staying at one of the public campsites, we advise you pre-book as soon as you can and check out what is available and try to secure a spot.

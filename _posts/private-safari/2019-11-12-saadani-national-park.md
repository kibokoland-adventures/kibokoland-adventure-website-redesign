experience:
  what_to_see:
    - paragraph: "<b>Walking safaris</b> This is the best way to taste the reality of Saadani‚Äôs attractions. This activity is more available during dry season only. The expense for this is US$23.60 pp, plus a guide tip costing US$23.60 per group."

    - paragraph: "Wildlife drives Being a must issue that lodges offer vehicle safaris for wildlife drives to make visitors explore more main routes; during rain season care should be taken since Saadani has a notorious black cotton soil when detouring. A park guide costs US$23.60 per group."


    - paragraph: "<b>Boat safaris</b> This is an amazing activity seems to be relaxing and enjoyable. There is a big chance for you to spot hippos, crocs and many birds around the park. Interesting to watch the vegetation along the banks of the Wami river, having some sections there are also marked variations between the two banks, with areas of date palms and lush foliage on one side  and whistling thorn acacias reminiscent of drier areas of the country on the other country on the other. Expect to pay about US$50 per person."

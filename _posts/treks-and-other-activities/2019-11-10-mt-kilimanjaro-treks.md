  intro:
    - paragraph: "At  5,896m Mt.Kilimanjaro, Africa‚Äôs highest mountain and one of the continent‚Äôs magnificient sights. It‚Äôs located near Moshi town and is a protected area carefully regulated for climbers to enjoy the trekking and hiking. Since the high altitudes are full of snow caps and ice on its peak with a crater in it. It has three main volcanic peaks including Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It‚Äôs a mystery wreathed in clouds meaning Mountain of Light, Mount of Greatness or Mountain of Caravans. "

    - paragraph: "In the lower slopes much of it is cultivated main purpose for subsistence and cash sale. The farmland includes coffee, banana, cassava and maize crop. Without forgetting that there is also existence of national park, including the fact that outside the national park there is subdivisions of small plots. Once inside the park there is thick lowland forest that breaks into alpine meadows once the air begins to thin." 
    - paragraph: "Mount Kilimanjaro national park has these kinds of animals like giraffes, warthogs, water buffalo, Colobus monkeys, blue monkeys, bush buck and did dik, many many birds around. Abit of luck to spot elephants and hyenas."

    - paagraph: "For the climbers there are three good routes that must be used to reach Kilimanjaro‚Äôs peak. Beginning with Marangu routes where is the starting point of the journey and also Lemosh/shira route, Umbwe route, and then Rongai route and lastly Northern circuit route. It‚Äôs challenging though it needs passion and good health status."

experience:
  what_to_see:
    - paragraph: "<b>Birding safaris</b> Lucky enough this national park can praise itself having plenty of malachite sunbirds, in all areas where lobelias and protease grow, which is heath and moorland. You will have a guide to point out their voices to you. Also silvery cheeked hornbill it‚Äôs a large bird that likes eating fruits mostly lives in the forest. White necked ravens looks large, strong, scary beaks hanging around the campsites and huts in Kilimanjaro scavenging and hope for scraps."

    - paragraph: "<b>Wildlife watching</b> As you already got the vision in the introduction that there is existence of various wild animals in Kilimanjaro national park, the lower rainforest is home to many animals, including buffaloes, elephants, leopards, monkeys and elands are occasionally seen in the saddle area between Kibo and Mawenzi."


    - paragraph: "<b>Trekking Mount Kilimanjaro</b> Mount Kilimanjaro can be climbed at any time of the year but most favorable is dry season. This is from late June to October and from late December to February or early March just after the short rains and before the long rains. <br>During November and March/April, more likely the path in the forest to be slippery especially the Western Breach, covered by snow."

itinerary:
  - paragraph: " <b>Trek Marangu route </b> A trek in this route is typically sold as for night to five day return package, the extra night is recommended to help you acclimatize especially if you have just flown into Tanzania or from lowlands."

  - paragraph: "<b>Machame route</b> A spectacular day contouring the southern slopes before approaching the summit via the top section of the Mweka route. Usually six or seven day return."
  - paragraph: "<b>Umbwe route </b> it‚Äôs a steeper route with a more direct way to summit than other routes, having at least six day return if you can resist the temptation to gain altitude too quickly. The steep section is up the Western Breach is often covered with ice or snow that makes it impassable or dangerous. Trekkers who tend to attempt without proper acclimatization are forced to return back, so important thing is come properly equipped and travelling with reputable operator."
  - paragraph: "<b>Rongai route </b> This route is set up near the Kenyan border and goes up the northern side of the mountain."

  - paragraph: "Shira plateau route; This route is good for avoiding crowds, being challenging due to the fact that it begins at 3600m at the Shira Track trailhead. For that an extra day at Shira hut is recommended. Better chose Lemosho route, being the same with an advantage that it starts lower at Londorosi gate and is normally use eight days to get it done ( rather than six or seven for Shira plateau)"

  - paragraph: "Lemosho route; This is the most enjoyable route for scenery and acclimatization, starting two days in the forest before crossing the Shira Plateau and then joining up with the Machame route."

  - paragraph: "Northern Circuit route; The longest trip taking eight to ten days initially follows the same way as the Shira plateau route before turning north near Lava Tower and then continuing around the northern (‚Äúback‚Äù) side of Kilimanjaro before reaching the summit via Gilman‚Äôs point. "

It‚Äôs well known since its 70 km away from Mount Kilimanjaro, it has a popular warm up trek for Kilimanjaro climbers. Its one of the warming up treks that people underestimates.

itinerary:
  - paragraph: "<b>Trekking Mount Meru</b><br> Momella route This is the only route to take you to the destination point. Starting at Momella gate on the Eastern side of the mountain and goes to the summit along the northern arm of the horse shoe crater. Comfortably needs 4 days (three nights). Before the trekking you will have to camp and wait until next day to start the climb. Its high enough for you to feel the effects of altitude, so don‚Äôt rush up or underestimate it."

  - paragraph: "<b>Stage 1:  Momella gate to Miriakamba hut (10km, four to five hours, 1000m ascent)</b><br> In this stage there are two routes to begin one long route and the other short. For that reason many trekkers prefer the long route that passes across the forest for ascent and short route for down walk. Watch out for buffaloes. <br> From the Momella gate the road uphill an hour to a fig tree arch, a parasitic tree that grew wild fig that originated from around two other trees. From there its only the remaining arch that allows a car drive through, after an hour a car drive across the stream that‚Äôs above Maio falls and one more hour to Kitoto camp with excellent view over Lake Momella and out to Kilimanjaro in the distance. Almost one final hour to Miriakamba hut (2514m), from Miriakamba you can have a walk to the Meru crater floor (two to three hours) return. The path across the floor leads to Njeku Viewpoint on a high cliff overlooking a waterfall, with excellent views of the Ash cone and the entire extent of the crater."

  - paragraph: "<b>The second stage; Mariakamba hut to Saddle hut (4km, three to five hours, 1250m ascent).</b> <br> From Miriakamba the path takes 45minutes to reach Topela Mbogo (buffalo swamp) then 30 minutes to Mgongo wa Tembo(Elephant ridge). Whereby from the top the views are so great showing the crater and up the main cliffs below the summit. Continue through some open grassy clearings and over several stream beds(usually dry) to Saddle hut (3570) From the Saddle hut to the summit of Little Meru takes (3820m) it takes about an hour and gives an impressive view of Meru‚Äôs summit the horseshoe crater‚Äôs inner wall. As the sun set behind Meru, casting huge jagged shadows across the clouds, the snow on Kili turn orange and them pink as the light fades."
  - paragraph: "<br>Stage 3: Saddle Hut to Meru Summit and return to(5km, four to five hours, 816m ascent, plus 5km, two to three hours, 816m descent)</b><br> This stage along a narrow ridge between the outer slopes of mountain and the sheer cliffs of the inner crater, promises some of the most dramatic trekking anywhere in East Africa. During rainy season ice and snow can occur, so take care. If no mist, the views from the summit are spectacular. Sun rise behind Mount Kilimanjaro the views at the dawn are just impressive from Rhino Point(3814m), about an hour from Saddle hut as they are from the summit perhaps even more so because you will also view main cliffs of the crater‚Äôs inner wall being illuminated by the sun rise."

  - paragraph: "<br>Stage 4: Saddle hut to Momella gate (5km, three to five hours, 2250m descent)</b><br> From the Saddle hut, retrace the stage 2 route to Miriakamba. From Miriakamba, the short path descends gradually down the ridge directly to Momella gate. It goes through forest some of the way, then open grassland, where giraffes and zebras are often seen."

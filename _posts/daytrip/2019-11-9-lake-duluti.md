experience:
  what_to_see:
    - paragraph: "<b>Hiking</b>: Hiking takes place through a small trail that has been cleared out by the reserve authorities, going through the whole perimeter of the lake, keeping close to the water's edge at all times. The path is normally well maintained throughout the year."

    - paragraph: "<b>Canoeing</b> go canoeing to explore the lake from a different perspective. This is a great way to explore the marsh areas of the lake. Here, huge papyrus plants are a noisy, colourful nesting ground for many of the birds. Usually a canoe trip around the lake takes around 2-3 hours."

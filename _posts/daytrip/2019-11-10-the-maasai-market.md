overview:


  intro: >
    A short but bumpy drive from Moshi are the clear, turquoise waters of the Chemka Hot Springs, 
    an oasis of geothermal warmth that bubbles up from underground. <br> 🥳  <br>
    Surrounded by lush forest alive with birdsong and the call of monkeys, 
    the Chemka Hot Springs is an ideal place to ease those tired legs after a strenuous ascent up Kilimanjaro. 
    They’re a little bit of heaven that’s perfect for a daytrip, and those warm blue waters invite you to linger, swim or explore. 
    Return refreshed, revitalised and relaxed. And if you really don’t want to leave just yet, we can organise and afternoon barbie or even an overnight stay.

experience:
  what_to_see:
    - paragraph: Montserrat, the “serrated mountain,” towers 4,000 feet intro the sky, with its jagged peaks and finger-like shapes. It’s a mesmerizing sight from miles away, even better as you enter the natural park. The view unfolds around you on the drive to the monastery.

    - paragraph: The Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey dates back to the 11th century, although it was rebuilt in the 19th century. It melds intro the mountainside and still serves as a home to nearly 80 monks.


    - paragraph: The abbey has always played an important role in the spiritual life of Catalonia; it’s a rite of passage to hike the mountain to watch the sunrise from the top of Montserrat.

    - paragraph: On the tour, you’ll have time to explore Montserrat on your own and take pictures of the amazing views. For a truly spectacular sight, take the funicular to St. Joan’s Chapel (not included in the tour) if there’s enough time.

##### **Day 1:**

##### **Meriakamba Hut**{:.mark}

On the first day, we get into the drive to Momela gate and start to complete the registration process with a full-armed ranger. After the successful process, we can get to view the wild animals that mainly include antelope, giraffe, monkeys, elephants and more. When it comes to dinner, then it can be done at Miriakamba Hut.

##### **Day 2:**

##### **Saddle Hut**{:.mark}

Then, there will be a walk to the saddle from mirikamba hut which is said to be the short day with a sheer climb that we need to do. If you get into the walk, then it must be slow in order to view the beautiful view of Meru Crater. Along with that, there will be also a chance of viewing Ash cone. Once the lunch is over, we will make a short climb to Little Meru for witnessing stunning views.

##### **Day 3:**

##### **Summit Day**{:.mark}

In order to climb, we will start at 1.30 am to approach Rhino point and then to Cobra point. Now, we reach the summit in terms of seeing Kilimanjaro’s peak. The best part of this view is where you can see ridgeline between sloping outer as well as inner cliffs of a crater. This could be the right time for you to take rest and have brunch at a saddle.

##### **Day 4:**

##### **Meriakamba Hut to Momella Gate**{:.mark}

On day 4, we go down in a faster mode through the ways of mixed forest and grassland by viewing wildlife creatures. Before reaching the Momella, you will get to view all kind of wild creatures in common for sure.

After spending some valuable time game driving in the park you then shall head off driving towards Karatu where you will spend the night. DAY 2: Tarangire to Serengeti National Park We&#39;ll take an early breakfast, as we&#39;ve got a big day of exploration and adventure ahead of us! We will begin the day with a drive towards the Serengeti. Along the way, we will pass through the rainforests of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area where you might be lucky enough to glimpse Cape buffalo, baboons, or even elephants and leopards in the dense undergrowth. Witness Africa&#39;s iconic savannah landscape and be amazed by the sheer number of animals that roam these grassy plains. Before the sun sets we shall drive to our lodge for an overnight DAY 3: Full Day Serengeti National Park Today we spend the entire day at the Serengeti.

Another big draw card to this picturesque national park, is its dense population of predators, which include lions, hyenas, jackals, cheetahs and the ever-elusive leopard, which sometimes requires a trained eye to spot. We will visit Lake Magadi, a large but shallow alkaline lake in the southwestern corner, which is one of the main features of the crater. A large number of flamingos, hippos and other water birds can usually been seen here. DAY 6: Ngorongoro to Lake Manyara to Arusha We shall leave the lodge after breakfast for a drive to Lake Manyara National Park.Bird-watchers will find Lake Manyara an absolute delight, with a huge variety of birds on display in the park.
